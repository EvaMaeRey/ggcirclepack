The goal of ggcirclepack is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggcirclepack from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/ggcirclepack")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(ggcirclepack)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

gapminder::gapminder %>%
filter(year == 2002) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(id = country) +
  geom_polygon_circlepack(alpha = .5) + 
  coord_equal()
#> Joining with `by = join_by(id)`
```
